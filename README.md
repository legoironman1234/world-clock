## Development
Switching from LeafletJS to MapLibre GL JS to display the map hosted on the website.

While LeafletJS is a wonderful, open-source, simple to use mapping API, I found that the capabilities of handling dynamic elements in LeafletJS did not match my demands of the API. I suspect that MapLibre, a fork of the much developed Mapbox API could work, and more documentation on a more popular API might be prevalent. I hope to use LeafletJS for another project someday, I really enjoyed it!
